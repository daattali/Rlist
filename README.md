## This is an abandoned project

I originally wanted to make this package for two reasons: learning how to use R6, and making a nice way to navigate complex lists in R.  Very shortly after starting the work here, RStudio released an update that included auto-completion for lists, which makes it very easy to navigate lists within RStudio, so I no longer saw the need for this package.

I do realize that not everybody uses RStudio so there might still be *some* benefit here.  If anyone wants to pick this up from where I left off (I only spent several hours on this code), then feel free to do so!
